# CleanArchitecture

Thanks for checking out my github repo. There's not much to say in this readme since I wrote two articles about this repo here:

[Article 1 - Dagger 2 introduction](https://medium.com/@patrykpoborca/making-a-best-practice-app-4-dagger-2-267ec5f6c89a)

[Article 2 - Clean Architecture and Testing in JUnit and AndroidJunit with Espresso](https://medium.com/@patrykpoborca/making-a-best-practice-app-5-clean-architecture-testing-84a1672dd000)

To sum, the articles and this repo go into how to utilize Dagger 2 in order to setup and start your project. How to properly implement some variant of an Architecture so that your app is scalable and testable.
Finally we go over how to actually implement those tests. I have similar tests in both POJO (Plain old java object) Junit and Android Junit which utilizes Some mockito.
I also show how annoying/and or obnoxious it is to test imporoperly architected applications by actually testing my "PlainTweeterActivity"

I hope you learn something from this, if you have any questions or issues feel free to start an issue here or [tweet me here](https://twitter.com/patrykpoborca)

Thanks!
